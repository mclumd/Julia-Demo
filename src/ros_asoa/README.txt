Some notes:
  1.  If this is run on the arclab machine, someone needs to be logged in to the console and rosrun should be run from the
      console (rather than remotely).  Otherwise audio stuff doesn't work; presumably because pulseaudio detects it's a remote
      session (this should probably be fixed).
